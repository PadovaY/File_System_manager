the zip file contains:
four program classes:
	• FileSystemMember
	• File
	• Directory
	• FileSystem

additionally there is a tester class to show performance 
and functions in action.

The attached UML shows the program classes and the relationship between them
also the major methods and members of each class.

I had a great time,
thanks in advance,
